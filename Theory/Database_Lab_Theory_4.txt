1. LOWER FUNCTION 

SELECT LOWER(FIRST_NAME) FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE LOWER(FIRST_NAME) = 'steven'

here where checks condition
but whenever we need to display something we must write after select


SELECT ROUND((SYSDATE-HIRE_DATE)/7, 0) AS WEEKS FROM EMPLOYEES
SELECT (SYSDATE-HIRE_DATE)/7 AS WEEKS FROM EMPLOYEES

AS works as an aliasing function, its an optional
keyword.
sysdate indicates the total date


fm keyword works for neglecting zero/null values
which doesnt have any specific value
